    <h2> Related Experience </h2>
        <h3> Software Engineer Intern, Target <img src="./photos/TargetLogo.jpeg" style="width:40px;height:40px;"> </h3>
        <p style="padding-left:85px;"> Over this 10 week internship I worked on migrating Target's APIs over to new OpenStack Nodes.
            There were three types of migrations, however I focused on two: (1) off Apigee and (2) off old chef servers.
            Chef and Apigee are both API management systems. Conduct the assessment on several APIs to determine the necessary functionality and the API's flow.
            I mastered analyzing API flow through legacy Apigee gateway and reconstructed functionality in the new stack.
            The assessment included networking with API owners, developers, and consumers. My project had a very heavy focus on Target's infrastructure architecture.
            From this internship, I gained experience writing a gateway role, where I implemented CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing)
            which allowed me to open the API so that it's accessible to other domains. Tools that I use include but are not limited to
            Chef, Jenkins, Kibana/Splunk, GitHub, Intellij, & SourceTree. </p>
